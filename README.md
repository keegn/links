http://keeg.in/ - My personal site. 

http://newsy.com/apps/ - This is an example of the last project I worked on at Newsy. I wireframed and prototyped (html/css/content) multiple iterations of mobile app landing pages including the linked page. Site development was managed by a third party agency. 

http://apmfuel.com/ - This is a one page marketing site I designed and developed for a MFA Oil subsidiary. A few of the design decision were not my own (e.g. branding, background images, customer form input text layout).
